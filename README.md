# Egypt Places Guide | Visit All Attractions
A SPA - Single Page Application - built using ReactJS. It helps travelers to find the attractions in Egypt, and do what they actually came for - To know ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¬!

## How it works?
The application contains 3 components, The `Header`, `Menu` and `Map`. Simply what happens is:
- All places are retrieved from a custom JSON file contains the places in `src/data/places.json`
- Both of the `Menu` and `Map` components are using that `places.json` file to display the data
- The `App.js` is the Parent Component for all Sub-Components in this Application, it has the common `state` to manage changes

## Setup Instructions
- `git clone https://github.com/elharony/Egypt-Places-Guide.git`
- `cd Egypt-Places-Guide`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
A Live Preview will opens via `http://localhost:3000/` by your default browser!
